1. Start the React Native App (Frontend)
First, open your terminal and navigate to your React Native project directory. Then, run the following command to start the app with Expo:

npx expo start
This will open a new tab in your browser showing the Expo Developer Tools, and you can scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your iOS device to run the app, or press i to run the app directly in the iOS simulator if you have it installed.

2. Start the Node.js Backend
In another terminal window, navigate to the directory of your back end where index.js is located. Then, run the following command to start the back end:

node index.js
This will start your Node.js server, assuming everything is properly set up in your index.js file.

3. Try the App
Now that both the front end and back end are running, you can try using the app. Ensure that the app is successfully communicating with the back end, and you're all set!

Let me know if you run into any issues along the way! :)
